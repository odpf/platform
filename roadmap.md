# Roadmap

❇️ View the o[fficial ODPF public roadmap

Our product [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/odpf/projects/10) is where you can learn about what features we're working on, what stage they're in, and when we expect to bring them to you. The platform repository is for communicating ODPF’s roadmap. Have any questions or comments about items on the roadmap? Share your feedback via [ODPF public feedback discussions](https://github.com/orgs/odpf/discussions).

## Guide to the roadmap

Every item on the roadmap is an issue, with a label that indicates each of the following:

- A **status** that indicates the expected planned timeline for the release.
- A **progress** that indicates the stage of development of the feature.
- A **feature** that indicates the feature or product to which the item belongs.
- One or more **product** labels that indicate which ODPF product we expect the feature to be available in.
- Once a feature is delivered, the **released** label will be applied to the roadmap issue and the issue will be closed with a comment linking to the relevant changelog post.

## Release phases

Release phases indicate the stages that the product or feature goes through, from early testing to general availability.

- **alpha:** _Primarily for testing and feedback_

  Features still under heavy development, and subject to change. Not for production use, and no documentation, or support provided.

- **beta:** _Released for public feedback_

  Features mostly complete and documented. Timeline and requirements for stable release usually published. Limited support provided.

- **stable:** _Released for production use_

  Ready for production use for all users Approximately 1-2 months from beta.

## Roadmap stages

The roadmap is arranged on a project board to give a sense for how far out each item is on the horizon. Every product or feature is added to a particular project board column according to the quarter in which it is expected to ship next. Be sure to read the disclaimer below since the roadmap is subject to change, especially further out on the timeline.
